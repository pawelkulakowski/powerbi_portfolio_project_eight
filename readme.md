# Portfolio Project Microsoft PowerBi - Hotel Management Dashboard

Hotel Management Dashboard in Power BI is a powerful tool that consolidates key performance indicators (KPIs) and operational data into a visually accessible format, allowing hotel managers and executives to make data-driven decisions efficiently. By integrating various data sources like reservations, revenues, guest demographics, and operational costs, this dashboard offers real-time insights into the hotel's performance.

### Key Features of the Dashboard

- Revenue and Occupancy Tracking: Displays real-time data on room revenue, occupancy rates, and trends over time. This helps the management assess business performance and forecast future revenues.
- Guest Insights: Breaks down guest demographics, such as nationality, age group, or booking channels, enabling better marketing strategies and personalized services.
- Reservation Analysis: Monitors booking patterns and cancellations, highlighting peak seasons or areas needing improvement in occupancy management.
- Operational Metrics: Tracks key operations like housekeeping efficiency, maintenance costs, and staff performance to optimize daily operations and reduce costs.
- Comparative Performance: Allows comparison of multiple properties (if managing more than one hotel) and benchmarking against industry standards or internal goals.

Project is in development phase.
